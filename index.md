# election 2020: The great model face-off

I’ve built this website to compare how well [538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast) and [The Economist](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president) predict the election results. 

I'm NOT all that interested in which famous statistician ‘wins the day’, however I AM really interested in how the assumptions we make in models play out in real-life (and high-stakes) scenarios. There has been a lot of [discussion](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/24/reverse-engineering-the-problematic-tail-behavior-of-the-fivethirtyeight-presidential-election-forecast/) on the relative merits of each model, focused mostly on shape of the distribution (whether a model included 'fat tails' that allow for a possibility of large upsets, and how to best model the correlation across states. These assumptions make a big difference, and share the narrative of how we expect each candidate to perform on election night.

On election night, I'll be compare the performance of these two models as the results come in.
